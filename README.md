At the beginning of the game, there will be randomly placed small line-shaped tokens (sticks) that connect two adjacent intersections of the grid, along a line of the grid.
An intersection that is adjacent with at least one stick, is called a node.
The first player selects any node of the grid and places a circular-shaped token (stone) on it. Next, the players must alternatively choose a new unselected node that is adjacent (is connected by a stick) to the previously selected one and place a stone on it. They use stones of different colors. The player who cannot choose another node, loses the game.
